`/subforcarmen subscribe: true` - Give the user the subscriber role

`/subforcarmen subscribe: false` - Remove the subscriber role from the user

This is a command that will ping a subscriber role, if a selected user is talking too much, for everyone to witness the drama

The user and guild which this command watches can be configured in `config.json`, under `subForCarmen.carmenID`, and `subForCarmen.guildID`. The subscriber role is under `subForCarmen.subscriberRoleID`

`subForCarmen.on` can be used to toggle notifications
